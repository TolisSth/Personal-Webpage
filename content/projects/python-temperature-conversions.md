This is a small app made in python using the tkinter library made in an hour or so, just to practice for my midterm exams.
All this is really is a temeperature converions app from 
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit
2. Celsius to Kelvin
3. Fahrenheit to Celsius
4. Fahrenheit to Kelvin
5. Kelvin to Celsius
6. Kelvin to Fahrenheit

There will be no update on this project, it was just a testing ground.

#PS: 
I was not planning on putting this project on the spotlight here, but today I was browsing through old github projects and I said why not.
