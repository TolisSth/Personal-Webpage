Development Assistant Script or else DAS is a simple script that will help *YOU* the developer download a variety of tools for the language that you develop on, much easier and faster. These tools will be a compiler or interpeter (depends on the language) and an editor or a full blown IDE in some cases.

This script was showcased by me, at an event that took place on 18/01/2023 on the AUTH campus, called "Εισαγωγή στα Linux και στο ανοικτό λογισμικό", organized by me and members of the ACM AUTH Student Chapter and supported by two professor of the department of informatics of AUTH. 

Feel free to take a look at the project or even constribute to it and don't forget to drop a like on the instagram post of the event.
