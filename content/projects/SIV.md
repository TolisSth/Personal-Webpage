SIV or else Simple Image Viewer is a small program writen in Java that enables the user to view images. This app is really simple and it is mostly directed to Linux users that access their files through the CLI and want an image viewer that can accept command line arguments. Of course this does not mean that the app does not have a GUI that enables the user to pick and view an image. 
 
This project is still work in progress but it has the basic functionality of an image viewer. My inspiration for this project is IMV the image viwer for X11. A minimalistic image viwer that just gets the job done.
