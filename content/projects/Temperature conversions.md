This program was made for my third semester java class. It's a simple temperature conversions app. It can handle:
* Celsius to Fahrenheit
* Celsius to Kelvin
* Fahrenheit to Celsius
* Fahrenheit to Kelvin
* Kelvin to Celsius
* Kelvin to Fahrenheit

The assignmen's feautres are done but the program is still work in progress, because I want to expand it, so you can expect certain features added.

We are currently on version 1.0.1 and some features to be expected are: 
* Light mode (ironic if you see this site)
* History of conversions
* A general refactor, I know that his does not count as a new feature but a quality of life update is needed.

With all that being said, stay tuned here and on github for the changelog.
