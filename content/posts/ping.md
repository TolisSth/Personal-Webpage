# Ping 
What do you do when a website doesn't work, you ping it. So this morning this website pinged my thoughts and here I am. Now that I am back let's have a Q&A (with myself and with someone that might stamble upon this page) to understand where are we going. 

## What's up with the gap year
I was quite busy with trying to find a job with my first degree, conducting research for a professor of AUTh and actually preparing myself for the panhellenic exams (for the second time). There are a lot of subplots here, like almost being a founding member of a company, getting a photo with Skiadareses (Greek band), having access to the national HPC system of Cyprus and being president of an ACM student chapter, but this is not a 2024 recap. 

## What's going on now? 
Well, I am still conducting research for that professor and I am still preparing myself for the panhellenic exams but now I am also preparing for my EU certification of my degree (hope I can find a job with this one). If those are not enough you are cleary not understanding how time consuming are the preparations for the two exams, the research is actually taking a small fraction of my time while giving me the most joy. 

## Is this page gonna work from now on ? 
I guess? I am still busy, but I want to talk about random things and I don't get to go out a lot to tell them to real life human beings, so this might do. 

## This question is being made because I want to promote a possible future article 
PLAYING WITH NFC TAGS FROM METRO TICKETS (Could not wait for the courier to arrive so I got myself some tickets from the local metro and used them as NFC tags)

yeah, that's all see you in 2 years or something.
