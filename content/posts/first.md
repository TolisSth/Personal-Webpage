This is my first blog on this new site, I welcome you, sit by me and watch me create this site from the ground up. Well not exactly from the ground, since I am receiving great amounts of help from my friend Hugo. Who is Hugo you may ask...well Hugo is this great tiny framework built in go that create stunning website in no time. Oh would you look at the time, I already finished building my website, this whole thing took me two hours and I am saying that just to point out how rapid is the development process with a tool like this one. Okay epilogue, uhm... I really don't have much too say so take this post as a "Hello World" for my new page and don't forget to come back later.
